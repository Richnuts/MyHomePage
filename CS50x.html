    <h2>My <strong>Honest</strong> Opinion About CS50x</h2>
    <p>
        Hi everyone, this is my first time to study computer science and I will review it.
        I have lot of interest in computer science and finally this is the time where I learn it.
        So basically CS50x is a free course for computer science that organize by harvard university and
        In my opinion CS50x is the best course that I ever attended,
        the lecturer here is really good (I never have someone to teach me this good)
        the explaination is so clear and the way the lecturer (david) explain to us in the lecture
        is really amazing for me. <br> <span style="color:red;">( 10 out of 10 from me :D )</span>
    <div class="harvard"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
        The subject for each week is fun and a brand new experiences for me XD,
        each week usually have 2 main assignment a lab and a problem set, where we must submit both of them.
        The lecture even have note so we can skiming it if we need something in the lecture that we forget.
        Overall in 8 week i have learn a lot, i have learn 3 language so far that is C, Python, and SQL.
        This course let you start from zero to hero.

        <p style="text-align:center"><h1>Language that I have learned</h1></p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>I really recommend CS50x</strong> for everyone who want to try studying computer science or programming
        because I think this is the best free course that you will have ever and there is a community that
        can help you to learn ( in my case I use discord ) where people there is so kind helping each other to solve
        the pset / lab problems.
        I feel that I understand a little know how to do some programming and it feels really great.
        I can not wait to finish this course as soon as possible.
